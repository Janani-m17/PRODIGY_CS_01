# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program

This Python program implements a simple encryption and decryption system based on the Caesar cipher algorithm. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- Encrypt text with a specified shift value.
- Decrypt text using the same shift value.
- Option to choose between encryption and decryption.
- Option to exit the program after each operation.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt when prompted.
3. Enter the value by which you want to shift the characters (positive for encryption, negative for decryption).
4. Choose the operation (encrypt or decrypt) by typing either "encrypt" or "decrypt" when prompted.
5. View the encrypted or decrypted text.
6. Decide whether to exit the program or perform another operation.

## How it works

```bash
python main.py
```

```plaintext
Enter the Text: Hello, World!
Enter the value to shift: 3
Choose operation (encrypt/decrypt): encrypt
Encryption:  Khoor, Zruog!
Do you want to exit? (yes/no): no
Enter the Text: Khoor, Zruog!
Enter the value to shift: 3
Choose operation (encrypt/decrypt): decrypt
Decryption:  Hello, World!
Do you want to exit? (yes/no): yes
```

## Learning

Through working on this project, I gained valuable insights into the following programming concepts:

1. String manipulation: Learned techniques for iterating through strings and manipulating individual characters.
2. Conditional statements: Utilized if-else statements to control program flow based on user input.
3. Function abstraction: Practiced encapsulating logic into functions to enhance code modularity and readability.
4. Loop structures: Implemented loops for repetitive tasks, such as continuously executing code until a certain condition is met.
